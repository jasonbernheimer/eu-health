Well hello friends!

Our Research Question: Does the proportion of primary care providers have an impact on health care spending on a country level basis. 

Conjecture: More primary care providers = less health care spending

Start looking at different OECD data and the things we can control for (could maybe do for between years as well).

1) Introduction: introduces the general topic, specifies your specific research question, and discusses briefly how you answer it and your findings.

2) Optional, and discouraged, literature review: COPY JASONS

3) Data: description of the data you’ll use in your analysis. You should provide summary statistics of key variables used and discuss any important features of the data (e.g., problems or limitations, things that stand out that might impact the analysis). You might include a graph or graphs to support your explanations. See below for additional details.

4) Methods: description of the econometric methods you use to answer your research question. You should discus whatever regression equation(s) you estimate. If there are obvious limitations to your methods or important or controversial assumptions required, you should discuss these as well. Note that the data and methods sections can be combined or separate. Choose the structure you feel best presents your research.

5) Results: present the results of your research. What is the answer to your research question? You should include table(s) of coefficients and some measure of significance (e.g., standard errors, *’s to indicate p-values). You should discuss the economic meaning of your results. That is, do not simply report a coefficient of 0.123. You need to interpret what 0.123 means, explain if it is statistically significant, and explain what real-world importance it carries (e.g., is 0.123 a lot or a little in the context of your question?). What are the limitations of your results? For example, are you missing a key variable that might impact your results? If so, what are you missing and how might this impact your results (e.g., would your results be “weaker” or “stronger” if you had the missing key variable)?

6) Conclusion: summarize your research question and answer, and briefly discuss areas of potential further research.


List of ideas for other variables:
- public/private healthcare or social protection
- childhood vaccination rates
- age/life expetency
- health education programs
- avoidable deaths
- prices of health equipment
- obesity/bad health
- 

How many of these are accounted for by country fixed effects?
